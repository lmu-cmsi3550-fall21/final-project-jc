# Final Project
The full application final project option includes two sets of instructions, one for the client component and one for the server component. Find them here:

* [Full Application Server](./README-server.md)
* [Full Application Client](./README-client.md)

If you are not doing the full application project option, you may delete the rest of this repository, upload your own files, and update this README to describe the goals and deliverables for your chosen project.
